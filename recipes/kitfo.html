    <p><strong>Kitfo</strong> is a very popular dish from the Gurage region of Ethiopia and one of the easiest to make. Kitfo literally means <em>chopped</em>or minced beef. It's served along with homemade cottage cheese during holidays and special occasions, such as Eid Al-adha. Lean red meat is mixed with clarified butter and Ethiopian herbs and spices, and it gets some heat from the spiced chile blend, mitmita. Traditionally, kitfo is served medium rare, but could be prepared according to the taste of the diner.</p>
