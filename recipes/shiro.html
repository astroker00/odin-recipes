    <p><Strong>Shiro (Ge'ez: ሽሮ, romanized: šəro)</Strong>, also called<em> shiro wat (Amharic: ሽሮ ወጥ, romanized: šəro wäṭ),</em> or <em>tsebhi shiro (Tigrinya: ጸብሒ ሽሮ, romanized: ṣäbhi šəro),(Oromo: Ittoo Dokkee)</em>, is a stew served for either lunch or dinner, originating from Ethiopia and Eritrea. An essential part of Eritrean and Ethiopian cuisine, its primary ingredient is powdered chickpeas or broad bean meal and often prepared with the addition of minced onions, garlic and, depending upon regional variation, ground ginger or chopped tomatoes and chili-peppers. Shiro is served atop <em>injera (leavened flatbread) or kitcha (unleavened flatbread)</em>.<strong> Tegabino shiro</strong> is a type of shiro made from heavily spiced <em>legume, chickpea, field pea, or fava bean, oil (or butter), and water</em>. It is brought bubbling to the table in a miniature clay pot or shallow aluminum pan. It is often consumed with dark or sergegna injera.
        Shiro can be cooked and added to shredded injera or taita and eaten with a spoon; this version is called shiro fit-fit. Shiro is a vegan food, but there are non-vegan variations that use niter kibbeh (a spiced, clarified butter) or meat (in which case it is called bozena shiro).</p>
        <h3>INGREDIENT</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup oil</li>
            <li>½ cup chickpea flour</li>
            <li>2 medium onions pureed</li>
            <li>1 roma tomato pureed</li>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic chopped
            <li>2 tablespoons niter kibbeh (Ethiopian spiced clarified butter)</li>
            <li>2 to 2 ½ cups of water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons berbere spice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 jalepeno chopped (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a heavy bottom stockpot to medium heat. Add pureed onions to the dry pan, and saute until they become dry and start to take on color- about 4-5 minutes. Add the oil and berbere spice. Saute for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. </li>
            <li>Next add tomato and chopped garlic. Saute for 2-3 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Now start whisking in about half of the chickpea flour. Gradually start to add about 1 cup of water. Whisk in the remaining chickpea flour and an additional 1 cup of water. Whisk until mixture is very smooth. Add remaining ½ cup of water if you prefer your shiro a little thinner</li>
            <li>Heat until the shiro begins to pop (simmer). Then add the niter kibbeh, garlic powder, sugar, and salt to taste, stirring until combined.</li>
            <li>Simmer for about 5-10 minutes over low heat until the flavors combine and the oil separates slightly from the shiro.</li> 
            <li>Garnish with jalepeno, if desired.</li> 
            <li>Serve with fresh injera.</li>
        </ol>
